# Gesture Tracker (WIP)

Application designed for developers and hobbyists expanding RedWren capabilities. By providing a
user-friendly interface for reading and analysing serial data, this tool facilitates the development
of gesture recognition systems using machine learning.

### Key Features
* Real-Time Data Monitoring: Connect to your devices and view live sensor data. The application
  plots the data on an intuitive graph, while simultaneously displaying the raw readings on the
  screen.
* Data Exporting: Save your read data to a text file for future analysis or backup purposes,
  ensuring that your valuable data is always accessible.
* Gesture Recording: Capture and repeat a flow of sensor data by manually invoking gestures. This
  feature allows for the collection of consistent data samples, which are essential for effective
  machine learning training.
* Machine Learning Integration: Transform your recorded gesture data into a standardised `.gesture`
  file that can be utilised in various programming projects. This simplifies the process of
  implementing pattern recognition in your applications.
