# CaptureSRM (WIP)

Application designed to expand OpenNetics capabilities. A user-friendly interface for reading and
analysing serial data, this tool helps create `.srm` files, holding machine learning models
for raw sensor readings; used for gesture and pattern recognition.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Monitoring:** Connect to OpenNetics device and view live sensor data. The application
  plots the data on a graph, while simultaneously displaying the raw readings on the screen.
- **Data Exporting:** Save read data to a `.txt` file for future analysis or backup purposes.
- **Pattern Recording:** Capture and repeat a flow of sensor readings. This feature allows for the
  collection of consistent data samples, and generating models based on the pattern observed.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Transform recorded sensor readings into a standardised `.srm` file
  that can be utilised in various programming projects. This simplifies the process of
  implementing pattern recognition in server applications.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to enhance the functionality
of the program.
