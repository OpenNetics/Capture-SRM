# Gesture Tracker (WIP)

Application designed to expand OpenNetics capabilities. A user-friendly interface for reading and
analysing serial data, this tool helps create `.ges` gesture files, holding machine learning models
for gesture recognition.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Monitoring:** Connect to OpenNetics device and view live sensor data. The application
  plots the data on a graph, while simultaneously displaying the raw readings on the screen.
- **Data Exporting:** Save read data to a `.txt` file for future analysis or backup purposes.
- **Gesture Recording:** Capture and repeat a flow of sensor data by manually invoking gestures.
  This feature allows for the collection of consistent data samples, and generating models based on
  them.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Transform recorded gesture data into a standardised `.ges` file
  that can be utilised in various programming projects. This simplifies the process of
  implementing pattern recognition in server applications.
